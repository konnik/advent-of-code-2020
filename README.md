# Advent of Code 2020 in Elm

Once again I'm trying to solve Advent of Code in Elm, hopefully managing to solve more puzzles than in 2019. :-)

You can try the solution on your own inputs here: https://aoc2020.konstenius.se/

## Running the code 

### Puzzle inputs

Your puzzle inputs should be placed as files in the folder `./static/input/`. On file per day named `<day>.txt`.

Example:

```
$ ls ./static/input/
1.txt  2.txt  3.txt  4.txt  5.txt  6.txt  7.txt
```

### Start the application

Install dependencies and run the application.

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Now point your browser to http://localhost:8000 and click on the numbered buttons to run each days solution.

Have fun.
